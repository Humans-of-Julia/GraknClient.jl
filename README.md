This is a community approach to translate a given client interface to the knowledge graph database Grakn, made by [Grakn.ai](https://grakn.ai/), into Julia Language.

Starting out as an educational project and to benefit the Julia ecosystem.

Please review the user guide or if you'd like to help building this check the contribution guidlines in the docs.

## What is Grakn about

Read up here: https://grakn.ai/

> Grakn is the knowledge graph engine to organise complex networks of data and making it queryable, by performing knowledge engineering. Rooted in Knowledge Representation and Automated Reasoning, Grakn provides the 
> knowledge foundation for cognitive and intelligent (e.g. AI) systems, by providing an intelligent language for modelling, transactions and analytics. Being a distributed database, Grakn is designed to scale over a 
> network of computers through partitioning and replication.
