This is a community approach to translate a given client interface to the knowledge graph database Grakn, made by Grakn.ai, into Julia Language.

Starting out as an educational project and to benefit the Julia ecosystem.

Please review the user guide or if you'd like to help building this check the contribution guidlines in the docs.

Feel free to join the project channel on the Discord server and take over a part in translating the given client reference into Julia.

# What is Grakn at all?

> Grakn is the knowledge graph engine to organise complex networks of data and making it queryable, by performing knowledge engineering. Rooted in Knowledge Representation and Automated Reasoning, Grakn provides the 
> knowledge foundation for cognitive and intelligent (e.g. AI) systems, by providing an intelligent language for modelling, transactions and analytics. Being a distributed database, Grakn is designed to scale over a 
> network of computers through partitioning and replication.

# How to start

It is suggested to start translating the Concept API.

You can read about it in the Grakn documentation [here](https://dev.grakn.ai/docs/concept-api/overview).


After we got that, it is adviced to wait for the Python Client 2.0 early December, so we can plan things.

For further questions about how to start, find us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/GdjHCNW8c8).

Feel free to clone the repo, create branches, pull requests, issues and all that is required.

Please find open issues that look for help in order to contribute.
