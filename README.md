# Graknclient WIP -- first steps

This is a community approach to translate a given client interface to the knowledge graph database Grakn, made by [Grakn.ai](https://grakn.ai/), into Julia Language.

In this branch we try out different things and implement parts of the client in a rough manner. 

Don't expect to find to much documentation and explanation in the code. This is only the workhorse where things will be worked out until they work for the tests.

Feel free to discuss implementation details in PR's or on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/762167454973296644/773324706924593192)

Have fun!
