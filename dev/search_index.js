making it queryable, by performing knowledge engineering.  Rooted in Knowledge Representation and Automated Reasoning, Grakn provides the knowledge foundation for cognitive and intelligent (e.g. AI) systems, by providing an intelligent language for modelling, transactions and analytics. Being a distributed database, Grakn is designed to scale over a network of computers through partitioning and replication.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Highlights-of-Grakn","page":"Home","title":"Highlights of Grakn","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Entity-RelationshipGrakn allows you to model your domain using the well-known Entity-Relationship model at its full expressivity. \nIt is composed of entity types, relationship types, and attribute types.\nUnlike other modelling languages, Grakn allows you to define type hierarchies, hyper-entities, hyper-relations, and rules to build rich knowledge models.   TypesGrakn provides to easily and quickly model type inheritance into the knowledge model. \nFollowing the object-oriented principle, this allows data types to inherit the behaviour and properties of their parent.\nLike functions in programming, rules can chain themselves to one another, creating abstractions of behaviour at the data level.   RulesGrakn allows you to define rules in your knowledge schema, which extends the expressivity of your model. \nIt enables the system to derive new conclusions when a certain logical form in your dataset is satisfied.\nLike functions in programming, that rules can chain itself to another, creating abstractions of behaviour at the data level.   InferenceGrakn's inference facility translates one query into all of its other interpretations. \nThis happens through two mechanisms: type-based and rule-based inference.\nNot only does this derive new conclusions and uncovers relationships that would otherwise be hidden, but it also enables the abstraction of complex patterns into simple queries.   AnalyticsDistributed analytics is a set of scalable algorithms that allows you to perform computation over large amounts of data in a distributed fashion. \nThey tend to belong to the family of MapReduce or Pregel algorithms (BSP). Often, this requires the implementation of challenging algorithms.\nIn Grakn, these distributed analytics algorithms are built-in as native functionalities of the language.
